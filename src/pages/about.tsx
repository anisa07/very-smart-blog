      This application is built with the latest web technologies to provide the best user experience.
      I've used a combination of ReactJS and NextJS to build the frontend of the application.
      Additionally, I've incorporated ChatGPT into the application to enable natural language processing and chatbot functionality.
      ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI, which allows us to provide intelligent responses to user queries and improve the overall user experience.
      I've also used tRPC, Next Auth, and react-query in this app.
      Thank you for visiting our About page! This page was also created with the help of ChatGPT.
